# Fullstack Engineer Assessment

Welcome to the technical test for the Fullstack Engineer position. This assignment is designed to assess your skills in both backend and frontend development.

This technical test comprises two sections: a basic [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) API implementation and a [React.js](https://react.dev/)-based frontend implementation.

### Backend API Implementation

- [ ] Develop an endpoint to retrieve the companies' data provided [here](./data.json).
- [ ] Push the code to a GitHub repository.
- [ ] _Optional: Deploy the application on a free hosting platform of your choice._

### Frontend Implementation

- [ ] Fetch the companies' data from the API you created.
- [ ] Categorize the companies by their respective industries. For each industry, render a card displaying the list of companies belonging to that industry, sorted in alphabetical order.
- [ ] The card's title should be the industry name.
- [ ] Display the count of companies in that industry at the top right corner of the card.
- [ ] Implement the company grouping logic by industry on the frontend. Ensure that your implementation is optimized for scalability, particularly in handling large datasets.
- [ ] Use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) to implement the card design. Refer to the [Figma file](https://www.figma.com/design/9GvGhDV1Te6bQzS1GLoj8J/Dealroom-FE-Assessment?node-id=0%3A1&t=I6Ph4vb2EAvbkQQ7-1) for design specifications.
